# Requirements

### Overview & Goals
The objective is to establish an enterprise-grade, generic, mature, domain-agnostic **Parent Master Context Engineering Framework** that synthesizes and elevates domain-specific plans (such as IoT, GenAI, Neural Networks, Database Migration, Mobile, Web, and Robotics spaces) into a unified, scalable agentic orchestration standard. This parent plan introduces **twenty-one (21)** core foundational capabilities (each referenced by a stable identifier `CAP-01` through `CAP-21`, in list order below) required for high-efficiency, zero-drift, tamper-evident, multi-module scalable, and cost-optimized AI-driven software engineering:

1. **Autonomous Operations on Multi-Format Minimum Viable Set (MVS) Inputs**: An auto-intelligent derivation engine that consumes sparse initial user inputs across multiple standardized formats (Markdown feature specifications, OpenAPI contracts, AsyncAPI event streams, ADR blueprints, structured Jira/Linear issue exports, and UI/UX design tokens) in `user/inputs/` (or `input/templates/`), normalizing them into a canonical Abstract Semantic Graph (ASG) to autonomously bootstrap, derive, scaffold, test, build, and document the complete project without human intervention unless explicit ambiguity gates are triggered.
2. **Context Poisoning Detection, Recovery Point Rollback & Incremental Replay Engine**: A resilient state control engine that continuously audits context purity. If context poisoning, hallucination drift, or invalid state propagation occurs, the engine rewinds project artifacts, git commit history, and agent state to a verified clean recovery point (`recovery_point`), quarantines and removes the poisoning culprit in `user/hitl/poisoning_quarantine.md`, and replays subsequent valid incremental enhancements seamlessly.
3. **Context Compression & GenAI Optimization Engine**: A systematic framework for context compression, token budget management, prompt caching optimization, AST symbol pruning, unified diff-based state updates, and context window tiering to drastically reduce token consumption and API expenses by 50–70%.
4. **Model-Agnostic Dynamic Multi-Model Cascading & Cost-Aware Token Tiering**: An intelligent, vendor-neutral multi-model routing layer that delegates tasks based on cognitive complexity while remaining fully decoupled from any single LLM provider (supporting Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT, DeepSeek, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, and local/private vLLM endpoints):
    - **Tier A (Frontier / High-Reasoning)**: Architecture derivation, cross-module contract verification, invariant gates, security audits, and context poisoning root-cause diagnosis. Reference models: `claude-3-7-sonnet / pro`, `gemini-2.0-pro`, `gpt-4o / o1`, `deepseek-r1`.
    - **Tier B (Fast / Compact / High-Throughput)**: AST symbol extraction, unified diff application, test scaffolding, commit drafting, and dashboard JSON serialization. Reference models: `claude-3-5-haiku / flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gpt-4o-mini`.
    - **Tier C (Deterministic / Offline Rules Engine)**: Local AST pruning, cryptographic SHA-256 Merkle chain verification, and offline regex sentinel scanning.
    - Backed by hard budget ceilings, token burn monitoring, and automatic throttle/down-shift policies.
5. **Git Worktree Workspace Isolation for Concurrent Subagents**: An isolated concurrent execution engine leveraging ephemeral Git worktrees (`.workspaces/subagent_<id>/`). Subagents develop in sandboxed worktrees with independent working directories, preventing concurrent file merge collisions and ledger write races, backed by atomic verification gate merges back to `main`.
6. **Automated Spec-to-Code Semantic Parity & Anti-Drift Engine**: A quantitative anti-drift subsystem measuring semantic parity (0.00 to 1.00) between `user/inputs/` specs and `workplace/src/` implementations via AST contract analysis and semantic embeddings. Features a bi-directional reconciliation protocol supporting both *Revert Mode* (restoring drifted code to spec) and *Evolve Mode* (updating the specification delta via HITL approval).
7. **Bounded TDD Self-Healing Engine with Test Quarantine Ledger**: A strictly bounded self-healing loop (configurable max retry attempts, default: 3) for test failures. Prevents infinite looping and token thrashing by automatically quarantining persistently failing or flaky tests into `quarantined_tests` in `context_ledger.yaml`, auto-filing high-priority tickets in `remaining_issues`, and safely pausing at `user/hitl/`.
8. **Cryptographic Ledger Hash-Chain & Tamper-Evident Audit Trail**: A tamper-evident Merkle block chaining mechanism (`ledger_chain`) securing every transition in `context_ledger.yaml`. Each ledger block records `{ block_id, prev_block_hash, current_block_hash, merkle_root, timestamp }`, guaranteeing non-repudiation and enterprise regulatory auditability (SOC2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA).
9. **Time-Travel Debugging & Visual DAG Dashboard**: A lightweight, static web dashboard generated at `user/outputs/dashboard/index.html`. Provides interactive DAG graph visualization of artifact lineage, visual diffing between any two recovery points ($RP_a$ vs $RP_b$), real-time token burn and prompt cache hit rate tracking, and one-click HITL review and clarification management.
10. **Multi-Dimensional Context Maturity Evaluation Report**: A comprehensive, quantitative evaluation matrix in `user/outputs/` and `context/reports/` assessing project context across six dimensions (Requirement Coverage, Architecture & Design Grounding, Code & Config Quality, Test & Verification Coverage, Security & Compliance, and Token/GenAI Efficiency).
11. **Master Context Ledger (`context_ledger.yaml`) with Integrated Git Commit & Issue Tracker**: A machine-readable DAG in `context/` that logs all artifact lineage, tracks issued Git commits with full requirement traceability, manages open remaining issues, enforces a standard checklist of common technical issues, captures model-suggested improvements, and registers recovery point snapshots in a standardized format.
12. **Universal Quad-Space Clean Folder Bootstrapping & Multi-Agent Flow**: Standardized scaffolding strictly partitioning customer-owned mutable directories (`workplace/` with `config/`, and `user/` with `inputs/`, `hitl/`, `outputs/`) from Neutron Binary proprietary logic (`context/` and `agentic/`). In enterprise deployments, `context/` (governance, schemas, DAG state engine) and `agentic/` (system prompts, bootstrapping/derivation metaprompts, model tiering router, workflows) are obfuscated, compiled, and cryptographically sealed inside `.nbpack` envelopes, hydrated exclusively inside an in-memory enclave to protect proprietary IP while leaving customer workspaces clean.
13. **Zero-Overhead Dual-Mode Architecture (Single-Module vs. Poly-Module Ecosystem)**: A dual-operating mode configured via `project.mode: single_module | multi_module`. In `single_module` mode, the framework maintains absolute simplicity with zero nested directory overhead (flat `workplace/src/` and `workplace/config/`). In `multi_module` mode, the framework coordinates heterogeneous multi-system projects (such as consumer interfaces communicating with provider services, event-driven microservices, or distributed data/ML pipelines) via isolated module subtrees (`workplace/modules/<module_id>/`), shared wire contracts (`workplace/shared/protos/` or schemas), cross-module interface specifications (`context/contracts/`), surgical module-scoped rollbacks, and virtual simulator loopback bridges.
14. **Proprietary Context & Agentic Space Obfuscation, Anti-Exfiltration & Cryptographic Package Sealing (`.nbpack`)**: A binary compilation, AST minification, and authenticated envelope encryption engine (`percipience pack`). Compiles proprietary markdown master plans, `agentic/` prompt suites, and `context/` governance/schema machinery into tamper-proof, Ed25519-signed AES-256-GCM binary envelopes (`.nbpack`). Hydrates both proprietary spaces directly into volatile RAM / secure sandbox memory without persisting plaintext files to the client's physical filesystem, preventing intellectual property theft, prompt injection, and LLM context exfiltration during `percipience init`.
15. **External Issue Tracker & Jira MCP Server Integration Layer**: A bi-directional Model Context Protocol (MCP) bridge connecting enterprise issue tracking systems (Jira Software, Linear, GitHub Issues, Azure DevOps). The engine continuously polls or subscribes to Jira via MCP servers (e.g., `@modelcontextprotocol/server-jira`), ingests "Ready for Dev" stories directly into the MVS processing queue, drives subagents through derivation and test verification, and automatically synchronizes issue states, test evidence, and Merkle block audit proofs back to Jira upon completion.
16. **Autonomous Closed-Loop CI/CD Triad (Self-Sustaining, Self-Recovering, Self-Improving)**: A fully autonomous continuous delivery engine (`workplace/core/autonomous_cicd.py`) that elevates CI/CD from a passive blocker to an active, closed-loop orchestrator. It comprises three unified capabilities:
    - *Self-Sustaining*: Proactively reclaims expired subagent worktree leases, purges uncommitted scratch diffs, garbage-collects zombie branches, validates WORM Merkle continuity, and enforces sprint token budget caps before resource exhaustion occurs.
    - *Self-Recovering*: Isolates regression faults into dedicated diagnostic worktrees, executes bounded TDD auto-patching ($\le 3$ retries), and, if unresolvable, triggers sub-1.2s surgical module rollbacks to verified recovery points ($\text{RP}_k$) without disturbing unaffected sibling microservices.
    - *Self-Improving*: Analyzes post-run pipeline telemetry, dynamically calibrates AST pruning thresholds (escalating from standard body stripping to aggressive internal helper pruning for high-token files to capture $+12.5\%$ additional savings), aligns prompt cache prefixes, and persists lessons learned into `context/ledger/self_improving_ledger.yaml`.
17. **Extensible Custom Agent Plugin Architecture & Workflow DAG Injection**: A standardized plugin model and engine (`workplace/core/agent_plugin_engine.py`) allowing teams to scaffold, configure, and integrate custom agent specialists into existing workflow DAGs (e.g. `agentic/workflows/pr_gatekeeper.yaml`). Follows the *Healthy Integration Pattern* enforcing ephemeral worktree sandboxing, AST token budgeting, pre/post contract verification, and cryptographic Merkle state sealing (`RP_AGENT_*`). If a custom plugin injects anomalies, the engine triggers surgical rollback to recovery points without collateral disruption.
18. **Production Token FinOps & Rev-Share Performance Metering Engine**: An integrated financial observability engine (`workplace/core/token_tracker.py`) that captures raw vs. AST-pruned token metrics across heterogeneous languages in real time. Automatically logs transparent accounting entries to `context/ledger/token_savings_ledger.yaml`, computing gross customer savings ($0.003/1K tokens) and 15% rev-share performance fees, backed by automated scorecard and whitepaper generation (`workplace/docs/reports/token_savings_report.md`, `workplace/docs/reports/token_savings_whitepaper.md`).
19. **5-Tab Enterprise Context Observability Hub & Telemetry Gateway**: A unified, zero-dependency browser observability control plane (`user/outputs/dashboard/index.html`) coupled with a production-grade HTTP/API gateway server (`workplace/portal/server.py`). Features 5 specialized operational tabs: (1) 6-Dimensional Context Maturity Radar & Remediation Diagnostics, (2) Autonomous Agent Swarm & Custom Plugin Manager, (3) Declarative Workflow DAGs & Invariant Gates, (4) FinOps Token Metering & ROI Calculator, and (5) Autonomous CI/CD Triad & Self-Healing Control Plane.
20. **3-Tier Layered Context Precedence Hierarchy & Bring-Your-Own-Repository (BYOR) Adapter**: A security and configuration architecture (`workplace/core/layered_context_validator.py`, `workplace/core/byor_adapter.py`) that enforces non-overridable platform invariants:
    - *Tier 1 (Base Platform Invariants)*: Core security contracts, Merkle schemas, and tamper proofs in `context/invariants/` (or encrypted `.nbpack` enclaves) that cannot be overridden by user prompts.
    - *Tier 2 (Enterprise Global Rules)*: Organization-wide policies and API contracts in `context/rules/` and `context/contracts/`.
    - *Tier 3 (Team / User Custom Context)*: Unencrypted domain schemas, custom agent plugins, and prompt templates in `context/custom/` and `agentic/custom/agents/`.
    - *BYOR Adapter*: Native multi-VCS adapter supporting self-hosted GitLab, GitHub Enterprise Server, and Bitbucket Data Center via SSH deploy keys and internal Root CA validation.
21. **Autonomous Living Documentation Engine & Architecture Visualizer (`agent_living_doc_architect`)**: An in-workflow living documentation engine (`workplace/core/living_doc_engine.py`) and specialist documentation subagent (`agentic/custom/agents/agent_living_doc_architect.yaml`) that executes autonomously during workflow runs, PR verification gates, and release cuts to create and continuously update living, drift-free documentation in `workplace/docs/`. It programmatically inspects codebase Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), wire contracts (`context/contracts/`), runtime configurations, and active layered domain specifications to synthesize: (1) Module Catalogs & Public API surfaces, (2) High-Level System Architecture & C4 Topologies, (3) Runtime Execution & Cross-Module Sequence Flows, (4) Data Transformation Pipelines & Event Streams, (5) Entity-Relationship & Relational Data Models, and (6) Layered Plan Domain Extensions (such as IoT BLE GATT profiles, Web3 P2P capability loans, or SaaS multi-tenant RBAC policies). It strongly prefers rich, executable **Mermaid** diagrams across all documents, hashes source files to enable incremental zero-token-overhead doc updates, and seals document revision proofs into the cryptographic Merkle ledger (`context_ledger.yaml`).

- **Time-Travel Debugging & Visual DAG Dashboard**:
  - Automated generation of `user/outputs/dashboard/index.html`.
  - Interactive visual rendering of artifact DAG, recovery checkpoints, module subgraphs, and agent handoffs.

  - Semantic sliding-window context summaries for multi-turn subagent execution.
  - Prompt caching optimization (reusing system and tool definitions with static prefix alignment).
- **Multi-Dimensional Context Maturity Evaluation Report**:
  - Evaluation scorecard generation across 6 core dimensions.

- **Integrated Master Context Ledger (`context_ledger.yaml`)**:
  - Full DAG tracking across all artifacts, module registries, contracts, recovery points, poisoning incidents, model tiering policies, worktrees, semantic parity metrics, quarantined tests, cryptographic ledger chains, git commits, remaining issues, checklist items, and model suggestions.
- **Universal Six-Phase Prompt Suite Architecture**:
  - `system_prompt.md`, `bootstrapping_prompt.md`, `derivation_prompt.md`, `evaluation_refinement_prompt.md`, `lifecycle_delivery_prompt.md`, and `workflow_orchestration_prompt.md`.

#### Out of Scope
- Direct cloud infrastructure runtime deployment execution inside the agentic AI engine's immediate inference loop (the AI engine provides full deployment manifests, CI/CD scripts, Dockerfiles, and provisioning manifests; Claude, Gemini, or GPT can be used as the reference reasoning engine).
- Physical hardware or bare-metal environment execution (automated integration testing is executed via containerized virtual bridges and loopback mock daemons; specialized hardware/embedded firmware concerns are encapsulated in layerable domain plans such as `.nb/plan/claude-context-engineering-iot-mobile-domain-plan.md`).

### User Stories
- **As a Commercial Software Vendor & Enterprise Architect**, I want to obfuscate and cryptographically compile parent master plans, `context/` governance schemas, and `agentic/` prompt suites into signed `.nbpack` bundles so that client installations (`percipience init`) run securely without exposing proprietary architecture IP, recovery state algorithms, or risking prompt exfiltration.
- **As an AI Systems Architect & Lead**, I want a universal, model-agnostic parent context engineering plan so that any project domain (IoT, GenAI, Web, Mobile, Neural, DB Migration) adopts a standardized, mature agentic structure that operates seamlessly across Claude, Gemini, GPT, or local models with zero vendor lock-in.
- **As a Poly-Module Solution Architect**, I want a unified space to manage multi-module systems (e.g., Client Application communicating with Core Backend Service via shared wire contracts) without breaking the simple structure of standalone single-module projects.
- **As a Polyglot Systems Lead**, I want versioned cross-module interface contracts in `context/contracts/` so that changes to API schemas, gRPC definitions, or event payloads are automatically verified against all producer and consumer modules before merge.

- **As an Autonomous Software Product Owner**, I want the agent suite to operate autonomously starting from a Minimum Viable Set (MVS) of sparse inputs so that complete systems are derived, built, tested, and documented with minimal manual overhead.
- **As a Financial & Engineering Manager**, I want vendor-neutral multi-model cascading and context compression across Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI models so that long-running agent workflows reduce token expenses by up to 70% by routing lightweight tasks to fast models (`claude-3-5-haiku / flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gpt-4o-mini`) and caching static prompt prefixes across any supported LLM provider.
- **As a Concurrency & Platform Lead**, I want subagents to work in isolated Git worktrees so that multiple specialized agents can develop and test features concurrently without file lock collisions or merge conflicts.
- **As an Autonomous DevOps Lead**, I want a self-sustaining and self-recovering CI/CD control plane so that build failures and test regressions are automatically diagnosed and patched within 3 retries or surgically rolled back without human firefighting.
- **As an Extensibility & Tools Architect**, I want a custom agent plugin template and automated workflow DAG injection so that new domain agents can be onboarded safely inside sandboxed worktrees without risking repository state corruption or context poisoning.
- **As an Enterprise FinOps Director**, I want real-time cryptographic metering of token savings and transparent 15% performance fee accounting so that our 62% AI cost reduction is auditable and budget-enforced.

- **As a QA & Test Lead**, I want a bounded TDD self-healing engine that quarantines intractable tests after 3 attempts, preventing runaway token spend while alerting human engineers via `user/hitl/`.
- **As a Technical Director**, I want a visual DAG dashboard and time-travel inspection tool at `user/outputs/dashboard/index.html` so that I can visually audit project evolution, diff recovery points, inspect module subgraphs, and track token spend in real-time.
- **As a Product Manager & Scrum Master**, I want Percipience to connect via Jira MCP servers to automatically ingest user stories marked "Ready for Dev", so that AI coding swarms begin implementing verified features directly from our Jira backlog without manual copy-pasting.
- **As an API Architect & Systems Engineer**, I want to submit schema-first OpenAPI and AsyncAPI MVS contracts in `user/inputs/` so that Percipience derives type-safe server stubs, client SDKs, integration tests, and database schemas with zero semantic drift.
- **As a Principal Architect & Full-Stack Developer**, I want an autonomous documentation agent (`agent_living_doc_architect`) running within our continuous workflow to synthesize and update comprehensive living documentation in `workplace/docs/` with Mermaid diagrams for architecture, sequence flows, data pipelines, entity relationships, and module catalogs, so that system architecture and code never drift apart and new team members can immediately visualize system internals.

### Functional Requirements
- **Proprietary Context & Agentic Space Obfuscation & Encrypted Bundle Compilation**:

  - Support `project.mode: multi_module` (scoped `workplace/modules/<module_id>/`, `workplace/shared/`, `context/contracts/`, federated ledger).
- **Cross-Module Contract Registry & Verification**:
  - Formalize shared interface contracts in `context/contracts/` (e.g., OpenAPI 3.1 specifications, Protobuf/gRPC DTOs, AsyncAPI event streams, shared JSON schemas).
  - Enforce `gate_contract_compatibility` ensuring both producer and consumer modules pass schema validation.
- **Surgical Module-Scoped Poisoning Isolation & Rollback**:
  - Support module-scoped checkpoints in `recovery_points` (`module_scope: <module_id> | global_system`).
  - Isolate context poisoning incidents to the culprit module (`culprit_module: <module_id>`), allowing unaffected modules to remain active without rollbacks.
- **Cross-Module Emulation Bridge**:
  - Scaffold cross-module integration test suites in `workplace/tests/integration/` connecting simulated components (e.g., client application communicating with virtual service daemon over local TCP loopback).
- **Quad-Space Directory Bootstrapping**: Automated creation and strict isolation of `context/`, `agentic/`, `workplace/` (with `workplace/config/` or `workplace/modules/`), and `user/` (`inputs/`, `hitl/`, `outputs/`).
- **Multi-Format Autonomous MVS Ingestion & Template Catalog**:
  - Provide and support 6 standardized MVS templates in `user/inputs/templates/` (accessible also via `input/templates/`):
    1. `mvs_feature_spec.md`: Natural language user stories, Gherkin acceptance criteria, business constraints, and non-goals.
    2. `mvs_api_contract.yaml`: OpenAPI 3.1 schema-first endpoints, request/response models, and error responses.
    3. `mvs_event_stream.yaml`: AsyncAPI pub/sub message schemas, Kafka/RabbitMQ channels, and idempotency guarantees.
    4. `mvs_adr_blueprint.md`: Architectural decisions, Redis/PostgreSQL topology, DDL schemas, and compliance trade-offs.
    5. `mvs_jira_story.json`: Standardized Jira / Linear JSON export format with issue keys, acceptance criteria, story points, and epics.
    6. `mvs_design_tokens.json`: Design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility rules).
  - Ingestion Normalizer: Parses heterogeneous MVS inputs into a canonical Abstract Semantic Graph (ASG) before triggering derivation.
  - Automatically infer database DDLs, configurations in `workplace/config/`, wire contracts in `context/contracts/`, implementation files in `workplace/src/` (or `workplace/modules/`), and test harnesses.
- **External Issue Tracker MCP Integration (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues)**:
  - Configure issue tracker MCP connections via `workplace/config/issue_tracker_mcp.yaml`.
  - Implement JQL query polling and webhook receivers via Jira MCP server (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-jira` or Atlassian REST bridge).
  - Support automatic ingestion queries, e.g. `project = PERC AND status = "Ready for Dev" AND labels = "percipience-ready"`.
  - Translate queried Jira stories into `mvs_jira_story.json` format and inject them into the active subagent worktree queue.
  - Bi-Directional State Synchronization:
    - Transition Jira issue to `In Progress` when an ephemeral worktree is leased.
    - Transition Jira issue to `In Review` / `Done` upon successful verification gate execution (`gate_contract_compatibility`, `gate_test_verification`).
    - Automatically append a structured Jira comment with the Context Maturity Scorecard, test coverage metrics, Git commit SHA, and SHA-256 Merkle block proof.
    - If bounded TDD fails (exceeding 3 retries), transition Jira issue to `Needs HITL Review`, link to `user/hitl/poisoning_quarantine.md`, and tag the issue reporter.
- **Context Poisoning Detection, Rollback & Incremental Replay**:
  - Create an immutable recovery point (`recovery_point`) snapshot in `context_ledger.yaml` at each verified milestone, committing workspace state to Git.
  - Continuously audit context against schema validators and independent verification gates for context poisoning or hallucination drift.
  - Upon detecting poisoning: (1) trigger `rollback_to_recovery_point(RP_k)`, (2) isolate and quarantine the poisoning culprit in `user/hitl/poisoning_quarantine.md`, (3) sanitize active agent memory and ledger state, and (4) execute `replay_incremental_enhancements()` for subsequent valid steps.
- **Model-Agnostic Dynamic Multi-Model Cascading & Token Throttling**:
  - Maintain a provider-agnostic model tiering map in `workplace/config/token_compression_rules.yaml`.
  - Support multi-provider switching (`active_provider: anthropic | google | openai | bedrock | azure | local_vllm`) with standardized cognitive tier mappings.
  - Automatically route tasks: Tier A (`claude-3-7-sonnet / pro`, `gemini-2.0-pro`, `gpt-4o`) for complex derivation, verification gates, and security audits; Tier B (`claude-3-5-haiku / flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gpt-4o-mini`) for AST parsing, diff updates, docstrings, and commit formatting.
  - Enforce token budget limits per sprint milestone; pause or down-shift when spend exceeds 85% of ceiling.
- **Git Worktree Isolation & Atomic Merging**:
  - Automatically spin up isolated ephemeral worktrees in `.workspaces/subagent_<id>/` for concurrent tasks.
  - Require verification gate pass before executing atomic merge back to `main`.
- **Automated Spec-to-Code Semantic Parity & Drift Reconciliation**:
  - Compute a continuous semantic parity score ($0.00 - 1.00$).
  - Execute automated *Revert Mode* (generate diff to undo unauthorized code drift) or *Evolve Mode* (propose spec delta for human sign-off via HITL).
- **Bounded TDD Self-Healing with Test Quarantine**:
  - Restrict test fix attempts to a maximum budget of 3 retries per test failure.
  - On 3rd failure, move test case into `quarantined_tests` in `context_ledger.yaml`, log an issue in `remaining_issues`, and halt at `user/hitl/`.
- **Cryptographic Hash-Chaining (`ledger_chain`)**:
  - Compute SHA-256 Merkle block headers linking each ledger revision to its predecessor.
  - Provide tamper-evident verification script (`ledger_chain_verifier.py`).
- **Visual DAG Dashboard Generation**:
  - Emit standalone HTML/JS/CSS dashboard to `user/outputs/dashboard/index.html`.
  - Render artifact lineage DAG, recovery points, module subgraphs, diff inspector, and HITL clarification actions.
- **Multi-Dimensional Maturity Assessment**:
  - Calculate scores (0.00 to 1.00) across 6 dimensions (Requirement Coverage, Architectural Grounding, Code/Config Quality, Test Coverage, Security, Token Efficiency).
  - Automatically emit context maturity scorecards to `workplace/docs/reports/context_maturity_report.md`.
- **Integrated State Ledger (`context_ledger.yaml`)**:
  - Maintain unified tracking across all 21 capabilities (`CAP-01`..`CAP-21`).
- **Autonomous Living Documentation & In-Workflow Mermaid Visualizer (`agent_living_doc_architect`)**:
  - *In-Workflow Lifecycle Hook*: `workplace/core/living_doc_engine.py` hooks directly into pre-PR verification gates, release workflows, and post-derivation stages to evaluate codebase deltas.
  - *Standardized Document Taxonomy in `workplace/docs/`*:
    1. `workplace/docs/README.md`: Central documentation index, system overview, and links to visual specifications.
    2. `workplace/docs/architecture.md`: System topology, component decomposition, communication channels, and C4 container diagrams rendered in Mermaid `graph TD` or `graph LR`.
    3. `workplace/docs/module_catalog.md`: Module boundaries, responsibilities, public interface signatures, types, and module-to-module dependency matrices.
    4. `workplace/docs/sequence_flows.md`: Critical runtime execution flows, cross-module request-response lifecycles, authentication handshakes, and error-recovery paths rendered in Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` with step autonumbering.
    5. `workplace/docs/data_flow.md`: End-to-end data ingestion, asynchronous event streaming, message broker routing, and state transition lifecycles rendered in Mermaid `flowchart` and `stateDiagram-v2`.
    6. `workplace/docs/entity_relationship.md`: Database tables, DDL relationships, wire contract DTO structures, and domain entities rendered in Mermaid `erDiagram` with explicit foreign key cardinality (`||--o{`, `}|--||`).
    7. `workplace/docs/domain_extensions.md`: Domain-specific documentation tailored dynamically to whichever layered plan is active (e.g., P2P torrent swarm topology and EIP-712 capability loans for `domain_blockchained_audio`; BLE GATT characteristic tables and A/B OTA partitions for `domain_iot_mobile`; RBAC roles and webhook handlers for `domain_saas_portal`).
  - *Mermaid Robustness Rules*: All generated Mermaid diagrams must enclose node labels containing parentheses, brackets, or punctuation in quotes (e.g. `node["FastAPI Provider (Port 8000)"]`), avoid raw HTML formatting, and pass offline syntax validation.
  - *Incremental AST Change Detection*: Maintain an AST skeleton hash store (`.scratch/doc_ast_hashes.json`); only re-render document sections and Mermaid blocks whose underlying source files or wire contracts have changed, avoiding token burn.
  - *Cryptographic Ledger Verification*: Register each documentation synchronization event in `context_ledger.yaml` under `living_docs`, sealing document hashes and diagram types into the active Merkle block.
- **Enterprise Reliability Hardening (Phases 1-3)**:
  - *Atomic Temporary Disk Serialization*: All critical state transitions (Merkle state sealing, token FinOps recordings, recovery snapshots) must execute via temporary file creation + `os.fsync()` + atomic `os.replace()`, eliminating corrupt, partial, or zero-byte ledger files during process crashes or concurrency collisions.
  - *Active POSIX PID-Probing & Stale Lease Eviction*: Ephemeral subagent worktrees must register their owning OS PID (`os.getpid()`). The runtime actively probes `os.kill(pid, 0)` upon lease operations, automatically reclaiming dead leases and running `git worktree remove --force` to eliminate zombie directory deadlocks without human intervention.
  - *Deep Schema-Driven Wire Contract Runtime Gate*: Wire contracts under `context/contracts/` must validate against JSON Schema Draft-07 specifications. Both inbound and outbound event payloads must undergo runtime validation (`validate_sample_payload()`), halting pipelines before schema mismatches reach production.
- **Scalability Hardening (Phases 1-3)**:
  - *Content-Addressable AST Skeleton Caching*: Structural AST pruning must employ SHA-256 content-addressable caching across memory and persistent disk (`.scratch/ast_cache/`), accelerating re-scans to sub-millisecond speeds (0.1ms) on unchanged source files and reducing AST parsing overhead by >85%.
  - *Rolling Merkle Epoch Checkpointing*: Scalable ledger verification must archive historical Merkle blocks into `context/ledger/archive/epoch_{start}_{end}.json` once height exceeds rolling thresholds, preserving constant $O(1)$ ledger read/write times while maintaining end-to-end cryptographic continuity through sealed `epoch_rollup_hash` references.
  - *Model-Agnostic Cognitive Tiering Router*: Runtime model dispatching dynamically routes routine subagent tasks (AST extraction, linting, docs, test runs) to **Tier B** (`claude-3-5-haiku / flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash`), delivering a 90% cost arbitrage while strictly reserving **Tier A** (`claude-3-7-sonnet / pro`, `gemini-2.0-pro`) for high-reasoning tasks (SemVer diffing, security audits, PR gate decisions).
- **Autonomous CI/CD Specialist Agent Plugins**:
  - Standardize five pre-configured specialist agent plugins under `agentic/custom/agents/`:
    1. `agent_flaky_test_detector`: Multi-run test stability analysis, quarantining intermittent non-deterministic test suites into `user/hitl/flaky_quarantine.yaml` as non-blocking.
    2. `agent_contract_compatibility_checker`: SemVer evolution guard, diffing wire contracts in `context/contracts/` to block breaking field removals or type mutations.
    3. `agent_dependency_cve_sentinel`: Supply-chain security, auditing source AST imports and manifests for CVEs, typosquatting packages, and restrictive licenses (AGPL).
    4. `agent_doc_drift_synchronizer`: Architecture sync, auditing exported AST interface symbols against `.nb/plan/` specifications to flag documentation drift.
    5. `agent_living_doc_architect`: In-workflow living documentation engine, synthesizing Mermaid visual architecture, sequences, data pipelines, entity-relationships, and module catalogs directly in `workplace/docs/`.
  - Wire all specialist plugins into a unified verification gatekeeper (`wf_pr_gatekeeper.yaml`, `workplace/bin/percipience gate`).

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Intellectual Property Protection**: Zero plaintext markdown or YAML leakage for `context/` and `agentic/` on client filesystems when executing from compiled `.nbpack` bundles.
- **Zero-Drift & Determinism**: All derived code and configs in `workplace/` must maintain 100% lineage traceability to `user/inputs/`.
- **Context Integrity & Poisoning Resilience**: Guaranteed recovery to clean state within < 1 step upon detecting context contamination or severe hallucination.
- **Zero-Overhead Single-Module Simplicity**: Single-module projects incur zero structural bloat, using direct flat directories.
- **Token Cost Efficiency**: *Target* of >= 50–70% token reduction in long-running agentic conversations compared to uncompressed context passing, validated by the benchmark harness (see *Benchmark & Metrics Provenance*). All percentage figures in this plan are targets until reproduced by that harness.
- **Concurrency & Merge Safety**: Zero merge collisions during multi-agent concurrent execution via worktree isolation.
- **Tamper Evidence**: Cryptographic non-repudiation of all ledger state transitions via SHA-256 block hashing.

### Benchmark & Metrics Provenance
All quantitative figures stated throughout this plan (e.g., "50–70% token reduction", "62% savings", "90% cost arbitrage", "+12.5% additional savings", "sub-1.2s surgical rollback", "0.1ms AST retrieval", ">85% parsing reduction", "cache_hit_ratio", "estimated_token_savings_pct") are **targets/design goals, not measured results**, until reproduced by the benchmark suite. Each figure MUST be tied to a reproducible methodology recorded under `benchmarks/`:
- `workplace/docs/benchmarks/methodology.md`: workload definition, corpus size, model/provider + version, measurement harness, warm/cold cache policy, and statistical treatment (median over N runs, confidence interval).
- `benchmarks/results/<date>_<provider>_<model>.json`: raw measurements linked back to a Merkle ledger block so a claimed number is auditable to the run that produced it.
- Until a figure is backed by a `benchmarks/results/*` entry it is rendered as a *target* in prose and in the dashboard FinOps tab.

### Canonical Model Tiering & ID Centralization
To prevent staleness and drift, concrete model IDs are **not** authoritative in this narrative. The single source of truth is `workplace/config/token_compression_rules.yaml`, which maps abstract tiers to provider-specific IDs:
- Prose and diagrams refer only to abstract tiers — **Tier A** (Frontier / High-Reasoning), **Tier B** (Fast / Compact / High-Throughput), **Tier C** (Deterministic / Offline Rules). Any concrete model name appearing elsewhere (`claude-3-7-sonnet`, `gemini-2.0-*`, `gpt-4o/o1`, `deepseek-r1`, etc.) is an **illustrative reference for the current epoch only** and is superseded by the config.
- The config carries a `models_epoch` date and a `review_by` date so tier→ID mappings are refreshed on a schedule rather than hard-coded across the document.

### Security Hardening: `.nbpack` Threat Model, TEE Attestation & Key Management
The "zero disk plaintext" + "RAM-only enclave" design raises the cost of exfiltration but does **not** by itself prevent IP theft on a host the client fully controls (the client can attach a debugger/ptrace, dump `tmpfs`/`ramfs`, or read process memory). The security claim is therefore restated and hardened:
- **Honest claim**: On an untrusted client host, RAM-only hydration *raises the cost of and complicates* exfiltration; it does not guarantee prevention. A hard IP-protection guarantee requires a hardware **Trusted Execution Environment** (Intel SGX, AMD SEV-SNP, or AWS Nitro Enclaves) with **remote attestation**: the enclave proves its measured identity to the Neutron Binary key server before any decryption key is released.
- **Key management**: The AES-256-GCM content key is never shipped inside the `.nbpack`. At `percipience init`, the enclave performs remote attestation and receives a short-lived, memory-only content key from a KMS/HSM (or the attestation authority) bound to the attested measurement; the key is zeroized on teardown and never touches disk. Ed25519 signing keys live in an HSM; only public keys ship to clients.
- **Anti-tamper degradation**: If no TEE is available, the runtime downgrades to a clearly-labeled "obfuscation-only" posture (documented as best-effort, not IP-guaranteeing) rather than overclaiming protection.

### Merkle Terminology Clarification (Tree vs. Chain vs. Epoch Rollup)
The ledger combines three distinct constructs, and the term "Merkle" is used precisely as follows:
- **Per-block Merkle tree**: within a single ledger block, a Merkle tree is built over all tracked artifact hashes, yielding `merkle_root`. This supports **inclusion proofs** (an artifact can be proven to belong to a block without revealing the whole block).
- **Linear hash-chain across blocks**: blocks are linked by $H_i = \text{SHA256}(H_{i-1} + \text{canonical\_json}(\Delta_i) + T_i)$, giving append-only tamper evidence across time (this is a hash-chain, not a tree).
- **Epoch rollup**: when height exceeds a threshold, a range of blocks is archived and summarized by an `epoch_rollup_hash` that commits to the archived segment, preserving continuity in $O(1)$ active state.

### Ledger Concurrency & Hash-Chain Serialization
Atomic `os.replace()` guarantees each write is all-or-nothing, but the hash-chain append (`prev_block_hash` → `current_block_hash`) must be **serialized** so two subagents cannot fork the chain:
- **Single-host / multi-worktree**: a single advisory file lock (`flock` on `context/ledger/.ledger.lock`) plus an in-process mutex guards the read-modify-append critical section; `prev_block_hash` is read, the new block computed, and the file atomically replaced while the lock is held.
- **Multi-host (BYOR / distributed)**: a distributed lock (e.g., DB row lock, Redis Redlock, or object-store conditional-put/compare-and-swap) provides the same single-writer guarantee; conflicting appends are rejected and retried against the new head.
- **Ordering guarantee**: appends are strictly linearized (each block's `prev_block_hash` equals the previous committed `current_block_hash`); a losing writer re-reads the head and recomputes rather than forking.

### Append-Only HITL & Quarantine Stores
To avoid reintroducing the write races that worktree isolation solves, mutable single-file HITL stores are replaced by append-only, incident-scoped directories routed through the locked ledger:
- Poisoning incidents: `user/hitl/poisoning/<incident_id>.md` (one immutable file per incident) instead of a single mutable `poisoning_quarantine.md`.
- Flaky tests: `user/hitl/flaky/<test_id>.yaml` instead of a single mutable `flaky_quarantine.yaml`.
- Each new incident file is registered in `context_ledger.yaml` under the ledger lock, so concurrent worktrees never contend on the same physical file. (The legacy single-file paths may remain as read-only rolled-up views generated from the directory.)

### Operational Semantics: Rollback Data Loss, Determinism, Observability & Secrets
- **Rollback data-loss semantics**: surgical rollback rewinds *agent-authored* artifacts and ledger nodes only. In-flight user-owned data in `user/` and externally-committed side effects (e.g., already-sent Jira transitions, pushed commits) are **not** silently discarded — they are captured in a `rollback_manifest` recording what was reverted, what was preserved, and any compensating actions required, surfaced to HITL before destructive rewind.
- **Replay determinism**: because LLM outputs are non-deterministic, "incremental replay" reproduces state via a **determinism contract** — pinned model tier + provider/version, fixed `seed`/`temperature=0` where the provider supports it, and a **cached-response store** keyed by `(prompt_hash, model_epoch)`. Replay first serves cached responses; only cache misses re-invoke a model, and any divergence is flagged as a replay-drift incident rather than silently accepted.
- **Engine self-observability**: beyond the customer dashboard, the agent engine emits its own structured telemetry (spans/metrics/logs, e.g., OpenTelemetry) for scheduler decisions, tier routing, lock contention, and enclave attestation events, so the *engine itself* — not just derived artifacts — is observable.
- **Secrets handling**: all secrets (issue-tracker tokens, VCS deploy keys, KMS/HSM handles) are referenced only by secret-manager ARNs/URIs (as with the Jira `auth_secret_arn` example) — never inlined in `context_ledger.yaml`, `.nbpack`, or logs — and are resolved at runtime into the enclave with least-privilege scoping and rotation.

### Input Template Path Canonicalization
The canonical location for MVS ingestion templates is **`user/inputs/templates/`**. Earlier references to `input/templates/` are deprecated aliases retained only for backward compatibility and resolve (via symlink/shim) to the canonical path; new content and tooling MUST target `user/inputs/templates/`.

---

# Technical Design

### Key Decisions
- **Multi-Format MVS Parsing & Canonical Normalization Pipeline**: Enterprise teams produce intent across varied mediums: product managers write markdown stories, backend architects write OpenAPI specs, distributed systems teams write AsyncAPI schemas, and UI designers produce JSON design tokens. Rather than forcing a single rigid input format, Percipience implements a multi-format ingestion engine with pre-scaffolded templates in `user/inputs/templates/` (and `input/templates/`). An AST normalizer maps any template format into an internal Abstract Semantic Graph (ASG), preserving typed constraints while allowing autonomous derivation to synthesize full codebases deterministically.
- **Jira & Issue Tracker MCP Protocol Bridge**: Rather than building proprietary issue-sync integrations for every ticketing vendor, Percipience leverages the open Model Context Protocol (MCP). By connecting to Jira, Linear, and GitHub MCP servers, the engine natively accesses issue details, acceptance criteria, attachments, and comments. A bidirectional reconciliation loop pulls "Ready for Dev" stories into the derivation queue and writes back verified commit proofs, maturity scorecards, and state updates upon completion.
- **Proprietary Context & Agentic Space Obfuscation & Sealed Bundle Architecture (`.nbpack`)**:
  - Master plans, `agentic/` (metaprompts, workflows, methodologies), and `context/` (schemas, validation logic, Merkle DAG engine) are compiled into `.nbpack` binary packages via `percipience pack`.
  - Features AST minification, identifier scrambling, Ed25519 digital signature sealing, and AES-256-GCM envelope encryption.
  - Plaintext proprietary logic is never persisted to client disk; hydrated directly in volatile sandbox memory during `percipience init`.
  - Customer workspaces expose only transparent spaces (`workplace/` and `user/`), with a sanitized state projection (`context_ledger.public.yaml`) for observability.
- **Zero-Overhead Dual-Mode Operating Model**:
  - Configured via `project.mode: single_module | multi_module`.
  - *Single-Module Mode*: Code lives directly in `workplace/src/` and `workplace/config/`. Single linear DAG. Global recovery points.
  - *Multi-Module Mode*: Code lives in `workplace/modules/<module_id>/` with shared DTOs/stubs in `workplace/shared/`. Versioned interface contracts in `context/contracts/`.
- **Cross-Module Contract Architecture**:
  - `context/contracts/` houses single sources of truth for cross-module boundaries (e.g., `service_contract.yaml`, `api_schema.json`, `event_stream_spec.yaml`).
  - Code generators (`protoc`, code-stubs) compile these contracts into module stubs in `workplace/shared/generated/`.
- **Surgical Module Rollbacks**:
  - In multi-module mode, recovery points are scoped by `module_scope: <module_id> | global_system`.
  - If context poisoning occurs in `mod_service_consumer` (e.g., hallucinated endpoint or invalid payload schema), only the `mod_service_consumer` working tree and its ledger nodes are rewound. The `mod_service_provider` remains untouched.
- **End-to-End Emulation Bridge**:
  - In integrated systems, client and service components are connected via virtual loopback sockets (e.g., WebSocket/TCP bridge or mock HTTP server) allowing automated end-to-end integration tests to execute in CI/CD without external infrastructure.
- **Quad-Space Clean Folder Architecture**: Standardize on four isolated top-level clean folders:
  - `context/`: Governance, schemas, contracts, state ledger, cryptographic chain, recovery snapshots, context maturity report templates.
  - `agentic/`: Prompt suites, agent role definitions, model tiering router, workflow DAGs, gates, hooks, replay mechanisms, methodologies.
  - `workplace/`: Implementation source code, test suites, `workplace/docs/`, AND `workplace/config/` (or `workplace/modules/` and `workplace/shared/` in multi-module mode).
  - `user/`: Dedicated input/output/HITL directory (`inputs/`, `hitl/`, `outputs/` / `reports/` / `dashboard/`).
- **Dynamic Model Tier Router**:
  - Tier A (Frontier / High Reasoning): Complex MVS derivation, cross-module contract validation, architectural verification gates, security audits, context poisoning diagnosis.
  - Tier B (Fast / Compact): AST symbol extraction, unified diff application, test scaffolding, commit drafting, dashboard data serialization, routine living documentation extraction.
- **Git Worktree Isolation Engine**:
  - Ephemeral subagent working directories created via `git worktree add .workspaces/<agent_id> -b feature/<task>`.
  - Atomic verification gate checks out isolated branch, executes test suite, and merges to `main` upon approval.
- **Semantic Parity & Anti-Drift Engine**:
  - Quantitative contract matching between input specs and code symbols.
  - Dual reconciliation: auto-revert unapproved drift or escalate approved evolutions to HITL.
- **Bounded TDD Loop & Test Quarantine**:
  - Self-healing retry ceiling = 3. Flaky or contradictory tests quarantined to prevent thrashing.
- **Cryptographic Merkle Hash Chaining**:
  - Block header formula: $H_i = \text{SHA256}(H_{i-1} + \text{canonical\_json}(\Delta_i) + T_i)$.
- **Time-Travel Visual Dashboard**:
  - Single-file zero-dependency HTML/SVG dashboard generated at `user/outputs/dashboard/index.html`.
- **The Triad of Autonomous Delivery (Self-Sustaining, Self-Recovering, Self-Improving)**:
  - *Self-Sustaining*: Proactive lease reclamation, zombie branch cleanup, and WORM Merkle continuity validation executed on scheduled cycles or pre-PR checks.
  - *Self-Recovering*: Autonomous fault diagnosis, ephemeral worktree test execution, bounded TDD auto-patching ($\le 3$ retries), and sub-1.2s surgical module rollback fallback sparing sibling services.
  - *Self-Improving*: Closed-loop telemetry feedback analyzing token burn and test pass velocities, dynamically tuning AST pruning thresholds (+12.5% compression gains) and prompt cache prefix alignment.
- **Healthy Custom Agent Plugin Integration Pattern**:
  - All custom agents conform to `agentic/templates/custom_agent_template.yaml` and the [Plugin Architectural Guide](file:///workplace/docs/guides/AGENT_PLUGIN_GUIDE.md).
  - Scaffolding, workflow DAG injection (`wf_pr_gatekeeper.yaml`), ephemeral worktree sandboxing, and pre/post Merkle block sealing (`RP_AGENT_*`) are governed by `AgentPluginEngine`.
- **Autonomous In-Workflow Living Documentation Engine & Mermaid Visualizer (Living Docs)**:
  - Software architecture documentation historically suffers from severe drift, rapidly becoming obsolete as code evolves. Percipience solves this by treating documentation as a compiled, living artifact of the codebase itself.
  - `workplace/core/living_doc_engine.py` and `agentic/custom/agents/agent_living_doc_architect.yaml` run directly within workflow executions (such as PR gatekeeper checks, post-derivation runs, and release cuts).
  - The engine inspects ASTs, wire contracts, and active layered domain plans, generating standardized Markdown documents in `workplace/docs/` with embedded Mermaid diagrams for architecture, module interfaces, sequence flows, data pipelines, entity-relationships, and domain specifics.
  - Changes are tracked incrementally via content-addressable AST hashes so that unchanged modules cost zero extra tokens.
  - A dedicated verification gate (`gate_doc_drift_verification`) ensures zero drift and verifies Mermaid syntax before code merge.
- **Token FinOps & 15% Performance Fee Accounting Engine**:
  - Real-time token tracking (`TokenTracker`) capturing raw vs. AST-pruned tokens across multiple programming languages.
  - Transparent accounting logged to `context/ledger/token_savings_ledger.yaml` computing gross customer savings ($0.003/1K tokens) and 15% performance fee.
- **3-Tier Layered Context Precedence Hierarchy & BYOR Multi-VCS Adapter**:
  - Guarantees Tier 1 (Platform Invariants / Enclave) cannot be overridden by user prompts or custom schemas.
  - Native BYOR adapter (`BYORAdapter`) connecting self-hosted GitLab, GitHub Enterprise, and Bitbucket Data Center with SSH deploy keys and internal Root CA validation.
- **Decoupled Enterprise Observability Hub & Telemetry Gateway**:
  - Zero-dependency interactive 5-tab dashboard (`user/outputs/dashboard/index.html`) backed by production HTTP/API gateway (`workplace/portal/server.py`).
- **Atomic Ledger Disk Serialization & Rolling Epoch Checkpointing (Reliability & Scalability)**:
  - Eliminates file truncation risks via write-to-temp, `os.fsync()`, and atomic `os.replace()` in `MerkleEngine` and `TokenTracker`.
  - Checkpoints historical Merkle blocks into `context/ledger/archive/epoch_{start}_{end}.json` once chain height reaches scale thresholds, sealing an `epoch_rollup_hash` in `context_ledger.yaml` to maintain $O(1)$ disk/memory access times while guaranteeing 100% cryptographic audit continuity.
- **Active POSIX PID-Probing & Worktree Lease Lifecycle Engine (Reliability)**:
  - Attaches OS process IDs to worktree leases in `.workspaces/leases.json`. Actively probes `os.kill(pid, 0)` upon lease acquisition, listing, and maintenance. Automatically purges dead leases and invokes `git worktree remove --force` to eliminate zombie worktree deadlocks without human intervention.
- **Deep Schema-Driven Wire Contract Runtime Gate (Reliability)**:
  - Wire contracts under `context/contracts/` strictly conform to JSON Schema Draft-07 specs. `LayeredContextValidator` and `pr_gatekeeper.yaml` enforce runtime event and payload validation, preventing cross-module interface drift.
- **Content-Addressable AST Skeleton Caching (Scalability)**:
  - `ASTOptimizer` indexes structural skeletons by SHA-256 content hashes in-memory and in `.scratch/ast_cache/`, providing sub-millisecond retrieval on incremental commits and saving over 85% in syntax tree parsing compute.
- **Model-Agnostic Cognitive Tiering Router (Scalability & FinOps Arbitrage)**:
  - Dynamically routes routine subagent tasks (AST pruning, linting, docs, test runs) to **Tier B** (`claude-3-5-haiku / flash`), delivering a 90% cost arbitrage while reserving **Tier A** (`claude-3-7-sonnet / pro`) for high-complexity reasoning (SemVer contract diffs, security audits, PR gate merge decisions).
- **Autonomous CI/CD Specialist Agent Plugin Fleet & 6-Stage PR Gatekeeper (Ecosystem Extensibility)**:
  - Standardizes five built-in specialist plugins in `agentic/custom/agents/`: `agent_flaky_test_detector`, `agent_contract_compatibility_checker`, `agent_dependency_cve_sentinel`, `agent_doc_drift_synchronizer`, and `agent_living_doc_architect`.
  - Integrates all five into the unified PR gatekeeper workflow (`wf_pr_gatekeeper.yaml`, `workplace/bin/percipience gate`).

### Comprehensive Component Inventory & Production Manifest

To guarantee enterprise rigor and zero ambiguity, every architectural component specified across the 21 core capabilities (`CAP-01`..`CAP-21`) is enumerated below with its intended Quad-Space location. The **Target State** column reflects the planned lifecycle stage for each artifact (`Planned | Scaffolded | Implemented | Verified`); because this is a design document, most artifacts are `Planned` until validated by the benchmark and test harness (see *Benchmark & Metrics Provenance* below). It must not be read as an assertion that the component is already built and verified.

# Testing

### Validation Approach
Verification is performed by executing the Parent Master Prompt Suite against synthetic single-module and multi-module MVS packages:
1. **Plan & Proprietary Space Obfuscation Verification Test**: Verify that compiling with `percipience pack --include-spaces context,agentic` produces an Ed25519-signed `.nbpack` bundle. Verify that initializing via `percipience init --parent-plan parent_master.nbpack` decrypts cleanly into RAM enclave without leaving plaintext markdown or YAML files for `context/` and `agentic/` on client disk.
2. **Single-Module Integrity Test**: Verify that initializing a single-module project produces zero nested folder bloat, uses flat `workplace/src/` and `workplace/config/`, and executes the complete lifecycle without multi-module overhead.
3. **Multi-Module Bootstrapping Test**: Initialize a multi-module project (`mode: multi_module`) with Provider Service and Consumer Module specs; verify deterministic creation of `context/contracts/`, `workplace/shared/`, and `workplace/modules/`.
4. **Cross-Module Contract Compatibility Gate Test**: Intentionally alter an endpoint payload schema in `service_contract.yaml`; verify `gate_cross_module_compatibility` flags the breaking change before merging.
5. **Surgical Rollback Isolation Test**: Introduce a context poisoning hallucination into the Consumer module; verify that only the Consumer module rolls back to its recovery point (`RP_CONS_004`), leaving the Provider Service builds (`RP_PROV_003`) completely untouched.
6. **Virtual Emulation Bridge Test**: Execute automated integration tests in `workplace/tests/integration/` where the client application simulator interacts with the mock service daemon over loopback, confirming request routing, payload rendering, and event streaming.
7. **Living Documentation & Mermaid Visualizer Verification Test**: Run `workplace/core/living_doc_engine.py` across derived multi-module repositories; verify that `workplace/docs/` contains complete, non-empty Markdown files (`architecture.md`, `module_catalog.md`, `sequence_flows.md`, `data_flow.md`, `entity_relationship.md`, `domain_extensions.md`), that all embedded Mermaid blocks pass syntax parsing, and that AST-to-doc hash synchronization avoids unnecessary token burn on unchanged files.
8. **All Core Capabilities**: Dynamic model cascading, bounded TDD self-healing, cryptographic Merkle ledger chaining, and visual DAG dashboard rendering.

# Delivery Steps

### Step 1: Define Parent Ledger Schema, Dual-Mode & Multi-Module Contracts
Establish the machine-readable YAML schemas for `context_ledger.yaml` supporting `mode: single_module | multi_module`, module registries, cross-module contracts, Merkle hash chaining, plan security parameters, and surgical recovery points.

- Define `context_ledger_schema.yaml` covering every section referenced by the `CAP-01`..`CAP-21` capabilities: `mcp_integrations`, `mode`, `modules`, `contracts`, `ledger_chain`, `plan_security`, `model_tiering_policy`, `token_optimization`, `worktrees`, `semantic_parity`, `quarantined_tests`, `recovery_points`, `poisoning_incidents`, `git_commits`, `remaining_issues`, `standard_issue_checklist`, plus the newer capability sections — `token_savings_ledger`, `self_improving_ledger`, `living_docs`, custom-agent/plugin registry, `layered_context` precedence policy, and forward-compatible `simulations` / `training_runs` blocks. The schema is validated against the `CAP` list in CI to prevent schema drift.
- Formulate cross-module contract specifications in `context/contracts/` (`service_contract.yaml`, `event_stream_spec.yaml`, `common_schema.json`).

### Step 2: Quad-Space Bootstrapping Metaprompt (Dual-Mode Aware)
Develop system and bootstrapping prompts establishing the Model-Agnostic Agentic Orchestrator's role (with Claude / Gemini / GPT as reference engines) supporting both single-module simplicity and poly-module coordination.

- Formulate `system_prompt.md` with zero-drift constraints, context poisoning defense rules, dual-mode execution rules, and Quad-Space registration rules.
- Draft `bootstrapping_prompt.md` dynamically creating flat folders for `single_module` or modular folder hierarchies for `multi_module`.

### Step 3: Develop Surgical Rollback Manager & Cross-Module Compatibility Gate
Build scripts and prompt handlers for module isolation and contract compatibility.

- Scaffold `surgical_rollback_manager.py` in `workplace/templates/recovery/`.
- Scaffold `gate_cross_module_compatibility` in `agentic/workflows/cross_module_orchestrator.yaml`.

### Step 4: Develop Cross-Module Simulation Loopback Bridge
Build virtual emulation bridges linking heterogeneous domain components.

- Scaffold `virtual_service_bridge.py` and `mock_service_daemon.py` in `workplace/templates/bridge/`.
- Wire up integration test runners in `workplace/tests/integration/`.

### Step 5: Develop Git Worktree Concurrency & Atomic Gate Merger Templates
Build scripts and prompt handlers for isolated concurrent subagent workflows across multiple modules.

- Scaffold `worktree_manager.py` and `atomic_gate_merger.py` in `workplace/templates/concurrency/`.

### Step 6: Develop Bounded TDD Self-Healing & Semantic Parity Engines
Build tools and prompt directives for bounded healing and anti-drift monitoring.

- Scaffold `bounded_tdd_healer.py` and `semantic_parity_checker.py` in `workplace/templates/healing/`.

### Step 7: Develop Cryptographic Ledger Chaining & Poisoning Recovery Engine
Build verification scripts and recovery handlers for state integrity.

- Scaffold `ledger_chain_verifier.py`, `recovery_point_manager.py`, and `context_poisoning_auditor.py` in `workplace/templates/recovery/`.

### Step 8: Formulate Visual DAG Dashboard Generator (Multi-Module Clustered)
Build the interactive time-travel dashboard engine rendering module clusters.

- Create `index.html`, `app.js`, and `style.css` templates under `user/outputs/dashboard/`.

### Step 9: Formulate Lifecycle Delivery & Multi-Agent Orchestration Metaprompt
Create incremental SDLC orchestration prompts with worktree concurrency, multi-module coordination, verification gates, hooks, and HITL clarification gates.

- Scaffold `git_commit_formatter.py` and `ci_cd_pipeline_template.yml` in `workplace/templates/delivery/`.
- Formulate `lifecycle_delivery_prompt.md` and `workflow_orchestration_prompt.md` linking all 21 capabilities (`CAP-01`..`CAP-21`) into an executable autonomous delivery flow.

### Step 10: Domain Adaptation & Validation Playbook
Produce comprehensive guidance for applying the parent master plan across domain spaces (IoT, GenAI, Web, Mobile, Neural, DB Migration, Robotics, Multi-Module Connected Ecosystems).

- Formulate `workplace/docs/parent_context_engineering_guide.md`, `agentic/methodologies/semantic_parity_guide.md`, and `agentic/methodologies/token_optimization_playbook.md`.
- Run verification tests against synthetic MVS packages to validate zero drift, single-module integrity, multi-module contract compatibility, surgical rollbacks, and simulator loopback bridges.

### Step 11: Proprietary Context & Agentic Space Obfuscation, Compilation & Binary Packaging Engine
Build CLI tools and cryptographic packers (`percipience pack`) for obfuscating and sealing markdown plans, `agentic/` prompt trees, and `context/` governance schemas into `.nbpack` envelopes with Ed25519 signatures and memory-only hydration.

- Scaffold `plan_pack_compiler.py` and `envelope_hydrator.py` in `workplace/templates/packaging/`.
- Wire `percipience pack --include-spaces context,agentic` and `percipience init --parent-plan <file.nbpack>` into the CLI runner to ensure proprietary trade secrets, metaprompts, and architectural blueprints are never exposed in plaintext on the client filesystem.

### Step 12: Enterprise Reliability Hardening (Atomic Writes, PID Probing & Wire Schema Gate)
Implement hardened system-level reliability guarantees across the Quad-Space workspace to eliminate file truncation, orphaned subagent worktrees, and broken wire contracts during high-concurrency or crash events.

- Implement `MerkleEngine.atomic_write_data()` and `TokenTracker.save_ledger()` using temporary file creation, `os.fsync()`, and atomic `os.replace()` to ensure zero corrupt or partial state files.
- Implement active POSIX PID-probing (`os.kill(pid, 0)`) in `WorktreeEngine` and `WorktreeManager` to automatically detect crashed processes and reclaim orphaned worktree directory leases.
- Implement deep JSON Schema Draft-07 wire contract validation and sample payload checking in `LayeredContextValidator.validate_wire_contracts()` and `validate_sample_payload()`.

### Step 13: Scalability Architecture (Content-Addressable AST Caching, Merkle Epoch Checkpointing & Cognitive Tiering Router)
Scale the context engineering platform for high-throughput enterprise repositories with thousands of files and extensive Git commit histories.

- Implement SHA-256 content-addressable AST skeleton caching in `ASTOptimizer`, achieving sub-millisecond retrieval (0.1ms) on unchanged source code.
- Implement rolling Merkle epoch checkpointing (`MerkleEngine.checkpoint_epoch()`) archiving historical blocks to `context/ledger/archive/epoch_{start}_{end}.json` with sealed `epoch_rollup_hash` references, bounding active ledger sizes to $O(1)$ while preserving tamper-proof cryptographic audit trails.
- Implement the model-agnostic `CognitiveRouter` (`workplace/core/cognitive_router.py`, `agentic/runtime/cognitive_router.py`), enforcing Tier A (`claude-3-7-sonnet / pro`) for high-reasoning tasks and Tier B (`claude-3-5-haiku / flash`) for routine tasks, realizing a 90% cost reduction on standard subagent tasks.

### Step 14: Autonomous CI/CD Specialist Agent Plugins & 6-Stage Gatekeeper Integration
Build a standardized fleet of specialist agent plugins under `agentic/custom/agents/` and integrate them into the PR verification gatekeeper.

- Scaffold `agent_flaky_test_detector` (`flaky_test_detector.py`) with non-blocking quarantine in `user/hitl/flaky_quarantine.yaml`.
- Scaffold `agent_contract_compatibility_checker` (`contract_compatibility_checker.py`) enforcing SemVer rules and blocking breaking wire contract removals.
- Scaffold `agent_dependency_cve_sentinel` (`dependency_cve_sentinel.py`) detecting compromised dependencies and restrictive licenses.
- Scaffold `agent_doc_drift_synchronizer` (`doc_drift_synchronizer.py`) auditing exported AST interface coverage against architecture plans.
- Upgrade `agentic/workflows/pr_gatekeeper.yaml` and `./workplace/workplace/bin/percipience gate` into a comprehensive verification pipeline.
- Expand the automated test suite in `workplace/tests/test_play3_suite.py` to end-to-end integration tests, validating all reliability, scalability, and specialist plugin subsystems.

### Step 15: Autonomous Living Documentation Agent & In-Workflow Mermaid Visualizer Integration
Build and integrate the autonomous in-workflow documentation engine and Mermaid visualizer (`agent_living_doc_architect`) to continuously synchronize `workplace/docs/` with zero drift.

- Implement `LivingDocEngine` in `workplace/core/living_doc_engine.py`:
  - *AST Symbol & Contract Parser*: Automatically extracts module hierarchies, exported classes/methods, REST/gRPC endpoints, event stream channels, and DDL entity schemas.
  - *Mermaid Visual Generators*:
    - C4 Architecture & Topologies (`render_architecture_mermaid()`): Renders boundary graphs (`graph TD` / `graph LR`) showing client tiers, API gateways, worker pools, persistence tiers, and virtual simulation bridges.
    - Module Interface Catalog (`render_module_catalog_mermaid()`): Renders module dependency graphs and tabular interface matrices (`workplace/docs/module_catalog.md`).
    - Sequence Flow Engine (`render_sequence_mermaid()`): Generates chronological `sequenceDiagram` models for request lifecycles, auth flows, and cross-module message dispatching (`workplace/docs/sequence_flows.md`).
    - Data Flow & Transformation DAGs (`render_data_flow_mermaid()`): Generates `flowchart TD` pipelines and `stateDiagram-v2` lifecycles (`workplace/docs/data_flow.md`).
    - Entity-Relationship Modeler (`render_erd_mermaid()`): Generates standard `erDiagram` structures with exact field typing and cardinality keys (`workplace/docs/entity_relationship.md`).
    - Active Domain Layer Deep Dives (`render_domain_extensions_mermaid()`): Inspects active domain layer IDs (e.g. `domain_blockchained_audio`, `domain_iot_mobile`, `domain_saas_portal`) and generates layer-specific diagrams (such as P2P swarm mesh topologies, BLE GATT characteristic graphs, or multi-tenant RBAC trees in `workplace/docs/domain_extensions.md`).
  - *Incremental Content-Addressable AST Hashing*: Maintains `.scratch/doc_ast_hashes.json` to skip re-rendering unchanged modules, achieving zero redundant token consumption during continuous workflow runs.
  - *Mermaid Syntax Validator*: Enforces node quotation rules (`id["Label (Details)"]`) and checks syntax validity before persisting Markdown files.
- Scaffold specialist agent manifest `agentic/custom/agents/agent_living_doc_architect.yaml` (Tier B execution for routine extraction, escalating to Tier A for complex architectural disambiguation).
- Inject `agent_living_doc_architect` and `gate_doc_drift_verification` into `agentic/workflows/pr_gatekeeper.yaml` and `agentic/workflows/cross_module_orchestrator.yaml`.
- Implement automated verification test in `workplace/tests/test_living_doc_engine.py` validating that document generation succeeds, all Mermaid blocks are valid, and Merkle ledger entries are sealed under `living_docs`.

### Domain-Specific Layering Architecture
The Parent Master Plan deliberately provides universal, domain-agnostic abstractions (`mod_service_provider`, `mod_service_consumer`, `service_contract.yaml`, `virtual_service_bridge.py`). Domain-specific software systems are decoupled into dedicated **Layerable Context Engineering Plans** that overlay on top of this framework via Tier 2 (Enterprise Domain Rules & Wire Contracts) and Tier 3 (Specialist Subagents & Workflow Plugins):

- **Decentralized Audio Streaming, P2P Swarms & Capability Loans**: Defined in [`.nb/plan/claude-context-engineering-blockchained-audio-streamer-space.md`](./claude-context-engineering-blockchained-audio-streamer-space.md) (encapsulates Web3 EIP-712 capability loans, P2P audio chunks, BitTorrent swarm mesh routing, IPFS content-addressed manifests, tokenized royalty splitters, and dynamic domain extensions in `workplace/docs/domain_extensions.md`).
- **Connected IoT, Embedded Hardware & Mobile Systems**: Defined in [`.nb/plan/claude-context-engineering-iot-mobile-domain-plan.md`](./claude-context-engineering-iot-mobile-domain-plan.md) (encapsulates BLE GATT tables, FreeRTOS/Zephyr C/C++, QEMU emulation, mTLS CSR handshakes, and dual-bank A/B OTA manifests).
- **Enterprise SaaS, Corporate Portals & Web Platforms**: Defined in [`.nb/plan/claude-context-engineering-saas-portal-domain-plan.md`](./claude-context-engineering-saas-portal-domain-plan.md) and [`.nb/plan/CEaasS/play_3_corp_site_saas_portal_plan.md`](./CEaasS/play_3_corp_site_saas_portal_plan.md) (encapsulates Next.js/React frontend portals, Tailwind CSS design tokens, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, multi-tenant RBAC policies, and Stripe/Paddle billing webhooks).
- **Standardized Custom Layer Template**: Reusable domain authoring blueprint defined in [`.nb/plan/templates/custom_domain_layer_template.md`](./templates/custom_domain_layer_template.md) and [`agentic/templates/custom_domain_layer_template.md`](../../agentic/templates/custom_domain_layer_template.md) for scaffolding domain wire contracts, specialist agents, and virtual simulator bridges.
- **Encrypted Layer Packaging & In-Memory Enclave Consumption (`.nbpack`)**: Proprietary domain layers are compiled and sealed via `./workplace/workplace/bin/percipience layer pack` and consumed directly into volatile memory (zero disk plaintext residue) with Merkle state transitions via `./workplace/workplace/bin/percipience layer apply`.
